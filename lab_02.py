'''
In this lab, we will be discussing different solutions to approximate predator-prey and competition models.
We will use Eulerâ€™s method and an 8th order Range-Kutta equation to approximate these models with the highest
accuracy possible. In this lab, we will be exploring how 2 different species interact with one another, 
and how competition and predator-prey relationships work through models. 
Throughout the course of this lab report, we will be attempting to create conclusions about different hypotheses. 
Here they are;
1. How are the behavior of the Lotka-Volterra equations dependent on the initial conditions and four coefficients?

2. How does the performance of the Euler method solver compare to the 8th-order DOP853 method for both sets of equations?

3. How do the initial conditions and coefficient values affect the final result and general behavior of the two species?

4. How do the initial conditions and coefficient values affect the final result and general behavior of the two species? 
   What new information did you gain from the phase diagrams plotted?

--------------------------------------------------------
TO REPRODUCE THE VALUES AND PLOTS IN MY REPORT, DO THIS:

1. To verify my code works for questions 1 and 2, and to replicate the graph in Dan's lab report, run 
    'verification_plot()'
2. To get phase diagrams for question 3, run
    'phase_diagram()'

This should be all. If you'd like to change any default values, you're more than welcome to by changing the values
each of the 'euler_solve' and 'solve_rk8" default values in my 'verification_plot' or 'phase_diagram' functions.
